/*
API Keys
--------
This is the longest step to getting set up, it involves filling in API keys for the supported services.
It should be pretty painless though and should hopefully take no more than a few minutes.
 
Each key below as a link to a page where you can generate an api key.  Fill in the key for each service below.
 
A note on services you don't need:
If, for example, your app only shares URLs then you probably won't need image services like Flickr.
In these cases it is safe to leave an API key blank.
 
However, it is STRONGLY recommended that you do your best to support all services for the types of sharing you support.
The core principle behind ShareKit is to leave the service choices up to the user.  Thus, you should not remove any services,
leaving that decision up to the user.
